For the full feature, we plan on having access to a database that contains the history of PM2.5 of a location, so we can provide an accurate estimation of the number of cigarettes you smoke in a week or a month."

The fact is air quality depends on several factors such as temperature, pressure, humidity and even wind direction and intensity. If the result seems weird for you, check <1>WAQI</1> and <3>OpenAQ</3> for more information and history on your station."
